                        <figcaption>If she's not travelling or listening to music, Emily usually has a book in her hand that she is completely invested in. She enjoys all sorts of genres of books and is always looking for the newest book from some of her favorite authors. She also really likes to visit books stores and spend large amounts of time just browsing the endless shelves of books.</figcaption>
