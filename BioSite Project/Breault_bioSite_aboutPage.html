                    <figcaption id="about-text">Emily Temple is a 22 year old female that lives in the state of Michigan. Born and raised in Michigan, Emily is a girl that grew up in a very quiet town in Michigan with her mom. Ever since she’s been able to, she has enjoyed reading at a very young age and continues to this very day. Any time she has a chance, she’s always looking to get her hands on the latest books she’s heard about or ones that were written by what ever her favorite author is at the time. Other than reading, Emily is also an individual who especially enjoys the hobby of travelling. Even with the current state of how things are in the world, she frequently dreams of where her next destination in the world will be. England, France, Italy, and Germany are just a few of the places that she has been to, with many more countries that she would like to visit on her list. In addition to many European countries, Emily has also done quite a bit of travel within the U.S. Her near-future plans are to travel to Greece during the summer of 2022. 

                        While not enjoying one of her hobbies or travelling, Emily is often working at the hospital as an x-ray tech. She went to school for about 2 years in order to complete all of her studies and training in order to get to where she is today. Although she does say that there are often ups and downs to the job, she ultimately enjoys the work she does and often likes to discuss the different x-rays she got to take during the work day. Her interest in radiographic technology all started with her interest in human anatomy and science. Ever since high school, Emily’s favorite subjects were all about learning about the human body and the science behind how the human body behaves. Although, she does say that despite dealing with them every single day at work, having to learn about all the different bones in the human body and memorize them is to this day the hardest module of her time at college. 
                        
                        In addition to the above mentioned hobbies, Emily also enjoys listening to various types of music and various popular artists both new and old. Just recently, she got to attend a country music festival called Faster Horses that she got to spend 3 days and nights at. She says that this is one of the greatest musical experiences she has ever got to witness. 
                        
                        As for plans for the future, Emily wants to continue to travel and mark spots of the world off her rather large list of places to visit. Although she doesn’t have it currently, she would some day like to have a house of her own along with a couple of pets. Some day, she would like to earn a good enough position at work where she is able to only work part time. That way, she says, she will be able to enjoy her past times much more often (especially travelling) and get to see many more places throughout the world.
